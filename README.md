This repo is a collection of Penetration Testing Utilities and Documentation that I have discovered and thought myself. Please create an ISSUE if you find something that doesn't work.

>## Arch Linux Note
>I am using Arch Linux, so the code for installation REPO and scripting may only work in Arch Linux.  I was going to use Kali, but since Kali has everything installed, I thought that it would be more beneficial to install programs as I need them to fully understand the process and how it works.  I will try to add Arch Linux Notes when I find something that I know is Arch specific.
