>### ARCHLINUX NOTES
>
>- Package is within the AUR and can be installed.  I had to seperately install a dependancy also using the AUR for it to work.  
>- I also had to download the compressed file using the link from the package as it would not download using the package.
>- PC will need samba installed on it.  When installing samba, it does not come with the ```/etc/samba/smb.conf``` file, so you can grab an example from the internet and create one.
